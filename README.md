# Split Counter App - Bug & Features request tracker üöÄ

Hey there, welcome! Here's the bug and features request tracker for known issues and wanted features for [Split Counter App](https://splitcounter.app), so if you have a bug to report you can see the ‚ÄúIssues‚Äù tab up top to see if it's already been reported, if not please create one for it and just add the "bug" tag! The same goes for feature requests, see if a feature you want was already added by someone to the list, if not, go ahead and ask for it and add the "request feature" tag. Although i'm just one developer working on the app, I will do my best to fix the bugs and implement feature requests!

## How do I report a bug?

To create a report, you'll need a [GitHub account](https://github.com/), which is fast and free to get.

Then, go to the ‚ÄúIssues‚Äù tab at the top, select ‚ÄúNew Issue‚Äù and simply fill in the form. *Please* make sure you include as much of the requested information as possible, even if you think it might not help, all the small details help, also please be polite in the discussions as well. Things to include in your report: your smartphone (maker and model), your OS version (i.e., iOS 16.1, Android 13, etc), steps to reproduce the bug, etc.

## How do I request a feature?

Kinda same as the above, go to the ‚ÄúIssues‚Äù tab at the top, select ‚ÄúNew Issue‚Äù and simply fill in the form and add the correct tag.

## How do I find out if my bug has already been reported?

Go to the ‚ÄúIssues‚Äù tab at the top, and there's a search bar at the top so you can search to see if it's already been submitted. If not, go ahead and report! If it has been reported though feel free to add more information to the discussion, or you can tap the + button with the smiley to vote on it to indicate it affects you too, this will signal me that it is happening to more people. 

## What can I do to help if the bug I'm having an issue with has already been reported?

A massive part of solving a bug is just about reproducing it, which just means being able to consistently make it happen. So if you are having a bug try always to explain step by step how to reproduce, this will help me try to understand the quickest why and what is happening.

## Why do I need to sign up for an account here?

GitHub's an awesome site that's well equiped for tracking stuff about a project, be it bug tracking, feature request tracking, etc. It'll help me keep things more organized since it is all centered in one place. Having to sign up for an account is super quick though and helps cut down on spam, so it's worth it. [Sign Up](https://github.com/)

## Can I participate in discussions here?

Of course! But try to stay on topic about the specific bug report, feature request, etc, so contribute if you feel you can add extra information. If you just want to say "I also have the bug" or "I also want this feature", use the + button with the smiley on a comment to indicate your reaction rather than creating another comment, this will signal me that there are more people that are interested or have the bug, think of it like a reddit upvote. This is unfortunately also not the place for off-topic conversation or memes, also please try to keep it clean here within the discussions!
